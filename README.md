# NMGetsSober
#### This is a resource for New Mexicans who suffer from substance use disorder and it'll connect them to treatment centers if they're seeking treatment or free community based activities if they're in sobriety.
#### Originally developed by Cindy Chen, Victor Chavez and Brandon Whyte for Deep Dive Coding's capstone group project.



###### It was built with React, React Bootstrap, Redux toolkit, Javascript, Geocoder API, and Mapbox API. The treatment center data was downloaded as a CSV from the SAMHSA website while the activity data was manually created from Google searches.
